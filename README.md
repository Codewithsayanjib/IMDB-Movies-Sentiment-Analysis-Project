# 🎬 IMDB Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis 🎭

A machine learning project for classifying the sentiment of IMDB movie reviews as **positive** or **negative** using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

***

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
- 🧹 End-to-end text data cleaning & preprocessing
- 📊 Exploratory data analysis with engaging visualizations
- 🤖 Comparative evaluation of multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM)
- 🏅 Model selection with comprehensive reporting

***

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Original IMDB Dataset:**  
  [🔗 Kaggle: IMDB 50K Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)
- Contains 50,000 movie reviews, each labeled as 'positive' 🎉 or 'negative' 😞.

## 🛠️ Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - 🔡 Lowercasing, 💻 HTML tag removal, 🧽 whitespace cleaning
   - 🗑️ Stopword removal, 🌱 Lemmatization

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - 🟦 Sentiment class distribution
   - ☁️ Word cloud & word frequency visualizations

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - 💡 TF-IDF vectorization

4. **Model Training & Comparison**
   - 📈 Logistic Regression
   - 💌 Naive Bayes
   - 🚦 Support Vector Machine (SVM)

5. **Evaluation**
   - 📋 Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - 🔍 Comparative analysis for best model selection
